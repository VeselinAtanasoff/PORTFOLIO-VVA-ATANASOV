"Repository context" v 1.0.0  Date:05-04-2025  Author:Veselin Atanasov

This repository serves as a personal archive and also a proof of skills for job applications. Anyone who finds anything useful in this repository is welcome to use it. :)
The repository is currently separated into a few folders corresponding to programming languages and special 'Projects' and 'EmbeddedSystems' folders. As my field of expertiese expands, I will keep adding more folders with different contents. 
The folders corresponding to a language, will include code with proofs of concepts for my skills in this particular language and the special folders will include big team projects in which I have participated or skills
regarding the name of the folder. The name of every project or assignment in this repository, will follow this format: Name_SkillExercisedHere1_SkillExercisedHere2... and so on. For example: "BME280Library_I2C-MasterSlave-C++-BitManipulation-Datasheets". "BME280Library" is the name of the project
and "I2C-MasterSlave-C++-BitManipulation-Datasheets" are the skills I used in this project.
